                <h4>Confusion is your friend! So is Spongebob!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming drink coffee if you like coffee. Otherwise choose the beverage of your choice.</p>

                <p>Confusion is a sign that you need more coffee or possibly less . . .
                    Regardless, don't lose heart because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Persistance plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, it'll likely be difficult but it won't kill you.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.  It's literally ok to enjoy the confusion because as stated above, clarity awaits if you'll just hang in there.</p>
